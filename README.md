## Getting Started
To get started using this Discord Bot, you first need to be in a Discord Server with the Bot. If you are not in a Discord Server with the bot, simply create a new Discord server and invite the Bot by [**clicking this link**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=758831061596635136&permissions=139586754624&scope=applications.commands%20bot).

Alternatively, if you want to run your own version of the Bot, you will need to clone the repository, create a new Application through the [**Discord Developer Portal**](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new Bot in the Bot tab, and copy paste the token into the Token.env file. Then, simply run the Main.java file in the src/bot folder your Discord Bot should now be running. Then, you can generate an invite link through the URL Generator in the OAuth2 tab to invite it to your server. 

## Instructions of Use
With the new [**Slash Command Update**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) the prefix has been changed to`/`. Therefore, to use the bot, start by typing a slash `/` into the message box, and a list of comands should show up from the different bots your server. You can filter out the commands from this Bot by selecting the **Mims Rucoy Calculator** icon on the left. Then, simply select the desired command to execute and fill in the required parameters. (Filling in optional parameters may change the output of the command).  The command list is below, and can also be found in the `/help` command.
